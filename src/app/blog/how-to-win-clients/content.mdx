Iâ€™ve been writing and producing music for quite some time, crafting refreshing and ear-catching tunes with hard-hitting drums, deep basses, and memorable vocal melodies. My sound is born out of my bedroom studio, where I experiment with beats and melodies to create tracks that resonate on an emotional level.

My discography includes my debut single Ecstasy (2021), an introspective track that combines throbbing basslines with evocative vocals. I followed it up with You (2021), a single that delves into the intricacies of connection and emotion. Most recently, in 2023, I released ittefaq, a more expansive project that continues my journey of musical exploration, blending organic soundscapes with modern production techniques.

These releases are just the beginning, as Iâ€™m constantly evolving my sound and pushing the boundaries of my creativity. Stick around for more original music, and be sure to follow me on my socials to stay up to date on new projects, behind-the-scenes content, and more. This is music created with passion, directly from my bedroom studio to your ears.
