        Iâ€™ve recently taken a major step in my musical journey by performing live at various gigs across Chennai. While the thought of getting on stage was once daunting, I decided to challenge myself, and over time, I've gradually gained the confidence and skill needed for live performances. It hasnâ€™t been an overnight transformation. Each gig presents new challenges, whether itâ€™s adjusting to the sound, engaging with the audience, or simply managing nerves, but with every show, Iâ€™ve become a little more comfortable in my own skin as a performer.

        Whatâ€™s most rewarding is how these experiences are helping me explore and discover new aspects of my musical identity. Live performances are unpredictable, and theyâ€™ve pushed me to adapt, experiment, and evolve in ways I hadnâ€™t anticipated. Iâ€™m constantly learning to express myself more freely, whether through my voice, guitar, or in the way I interact with the crowd. Itâ€™s almost like each gig opens up a new layer of creativity and connection to my music.

        The journey is ongoing, and I still have a long way to go, but I can feel the progress. Iâ€™m becoming more attuned to what works for me on stage and what doesnâ€™t, and Iâ€™m learning to trust my instincts more. Thereâ€™s something incredibly empowering about standing in front of an audience and sharing something as personal as music, and with every performance, Iâ€™m not only improving technically but also deepening my understanding of myself as an artist. Itâ€™s been a slow, organic process, but itâ€™s one thatâ€™s made me feel more confident in my musical abilities, and Iâ€™m excited to keep growing and exploring through future performances.
